Welcome to my homepage!

I am Hongao ZHU, a linguistics junior from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China. I have been engaging with computational linguistics, and long to pursue a Ph.D. program in this field. I am deeply intrigued by research on the interpretations of LLM's linguistic capabilities, as well as relevant discourse analysis.

To know more about me and my research interests, please visit the [about] page.

If you may desire to communicate with me in deeper depth, please check out the [contact] page.

Here's a copy of my [CV].
