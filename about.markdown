I am Hongao ZHU, a linguistics junior from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Shanghai, China. I have been engaging with computational linguistics, and long to pursue a Ph.D. program in this field. I am deeply intrigued by research on the interpretations of LLM's linguistic capabilities, as well as relevant discourse analysis.

My research focus is computational linguistics, especially concerning multilingual syntactic and pragmatic benchmarking for language models, authorship attribution in AI detection, as well as critical discourse analysis of news media. With deep interests and consistent practice in computational linguistics, I currently partake in the computational linguistics lab at SJTU as a research assistant.
